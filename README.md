# DGTesting

I have knocked up this app to help me understand how to make Syncfusion Datagrid work 
with the DRIFT database and PROVIDER.

I'm new at this so no laughing! :-)


## What Works

- Show data from database table
- Add a record
- Delete a record
- Filtering
- Sorting

## What's Not Right

- The code is doubling up all over the place
- I am casting far to much
- I still don't understand how to make Provider work for me in here properly.
